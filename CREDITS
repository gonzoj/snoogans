First of all, I'd like to note that this is NOT entirely "my" source code.

I want to thank the following people (and probably forget to mention some 
folks):

 - McGod,
 for releasing the source code of mMap. My implementation is heavily inspired 
 by his code and I actually ripped off many functions. Check out his Readme, I 
 guess I should thank those people, too.
 
 - The D2BS crew,
 for expending such an enormous effort for the community. I've learned a lot 
 about Diablo II's internals by studying parts of the D2BS core's code. The 
 function- and variable-pointers, as well as the structs for version 1.12 have 
 been taken from D2BS.
 
 - Anybody,
 who contributed to the community by releasing pointers / structs / hooking 
 code and updating them patch after patch (I've benefited from that for sure).
 
 - The active Blizzhackers,
 who spread knowledge on the forum and on IRC.

 - Mousepad,
 due to a request by ancienthit.
 
 - bullson,
 for spending time on testing / debugging my shitty code.
 
I haven't bothered to name most of the people explicitly, since there are just 
too many. If somebody feels not credited enough or finds himself not credited 
at all, although I use his code, feel free to contact me.
